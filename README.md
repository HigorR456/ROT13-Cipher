This project was based on the third challenge of JavaScript course from freeCodeCamp.

You can ee below a simple description from freeCodeCamp:,
 
"One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount. A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on."
